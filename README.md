```
# Installation
* nmp i
* node generator.js command
# Usage
The process of this project began by creating a prompt questionaire that will collect information from hte user to generate the Logo. Personally the most difficult part of this project was to import and export functions/classes that would be needed to execute other fucntions in the generator.js file.
